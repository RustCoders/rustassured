# The mdBook Experiement

Here I played around with [mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/), a tool in Rust for writing books which forms the basis of the [Rust Book](https://github.com/rust-lang/book). 

## Getting started:
* Install mdbook as documented here under [Build from source using Rust](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/guide/installation.html#build-from-source-using-rust).
* To view the book:
```
mdbook serve --open
```
